A cocktail reception is a party where guests are provided with refreshments rather than full sit-down dinner. Cocktail parties can be small informal weddings or corporal events, a book launch or a boutique opening. While cocktail party is not a black tie event with the strictest dressing rules it is not a casual dress event either.<br><br>So, here are the rules you have to follow to look great at a cocktail party:</h4>');

				document.write('<ul><li>Add some eye candy. Opt for jewelry that flatters your dress but don’t overdo: one or two items will be enough.  A diamond or pearl tennis bracelet adds just the right amount of sparkle to your wrist, so if you have one that matches your earrings, it\'s a good choice.</li>')
				document.write('<br><li>Don’t forget about a good purse, it is essential to carry it while holding a drink. Just a small one will do, big enough to fit your lipstick and a tissue and a few other personal items. Again, try to stick with the theme of your other accessories. If you\'re wearing lots of beads, look for a beaded clutch purse to go with your ensemble. On the other hand, a sleek black clutch purse with just a few rhinestones on it will go great with your gemstone jewelry. Avoid anything with a strap. You want your cocktail dress and accessories to look classy. </li>');
				document.write('<br><li>Wear dress shoes. Heels are the best option but flats are acceptable, too.  Choose a pair of shoes that have an open-toe and lots of straps. This type of shoe / sandal works for most occasions. Avoid anything that goes too high up your leg, or has too many embellishments on it. Think of comfort, cocktail party is usually long and you will have to be on your feet all the time. </li></ul>');
